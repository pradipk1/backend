* Till now, we have created a register, login, getLoggedInUser routes and also auth middleware is added in day10/server folder.
* Now today we will implement Github OAuth and also will create some client side UI inside day10/client.

* In this lecture we completed the github-oauth implementaion but it is not working properly. We will fix the issue in the next lecture.
